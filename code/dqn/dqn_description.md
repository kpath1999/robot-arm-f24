‘Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning’ introduced DQN, demonstrating the ability to learn control policies from high-dimensional sensory input. Much like A2C, it succeeds at learning from visual state representations and handles discrete action spaces well. DQN’s use of experience replay and target networks addresses stability issues often encountered in deep RL, potentially leading to more robust learning in this manipulation task. While fixed Q-targets do stabilize learning, this feature might slow down the adaptation to rapidly changing dynamics in the Kuka arm control task. Additionally, the algorithm's performance can be sensitive to the size of the replay buffer, which may need to be optimized to balance between retaining useful experiences and adapting to new situations. Implementing prioritized experience replay can help the agent learn from rare but important states, which is crucial in a complex robotic arm environment. Introducing a few modifications to DQN's epsilon-greedy action selection strategy may ensure adequate exploration of the state space. Instead of a fixed epsilon decay schedule, implementing an adaptive decay based on learning progress may help. This could involve slowing down epsilon decay when the Q-values are changing rapidly, indicating that the agent is still learning significantly, and accelerating decay when Q-values stabilize, suggesting that the current policy is becoming more reliable.

For robotic arm control, DQN's strength lies in its ability to handle discrete action spaces and learn from visual inputs. However, its limitation to discrete actions might restrict the fine-grained control needed for precise robotic manipulation. Additionally, as a value-based method, it might struggle with the exploration-exploitation trade-off in complex manipulation tasks, especially certain arm movements that require precise sequences of actions. DQN tends to overestimate action values, which could lead to suboptimal policy selection in the Kuka arm task. Compared to recent, more advanced algorithms, it may also be less sample efficient. Careful implementation and possibly few algorithmic modifications might be necessary to optimize DQN's performance in this specific robotic control task.
