A2C, introduced in ‘Asynchronous Methods for Deep Reinforcement Learning,’ is a synchronous version of the A3C method. A2C combines the benefits of both value-based and policy-based approaches, making it well-suited for environments with discrete actions spaces, much like the Kuka simulation, as well as continuous spaces. A2C operates based on a forward view, performing updates every t_max actions or when a terminal state is reached. This approach allows A2C to simultaneously learn a value function and a policy, potentially leading to more stable and efficient learning in the complex, high-dimensional state space of robotic arm control.

In the context of robotic manipulation, A2C's actor-critic structures allows it to simultaneously learn a value function and a policy. A2C typically employs a shared network architecture, with convolutional layers feeding into separate policy and value function outputs, enabling efficient learning from high-dimensional inputs like visual data from robotic simulations. The inclusion of an entropy regularization term in the objective function improves exploration by discouraging premature convergence to suboptimal deterministic policies, which can be particularly beneficial in robotic tasks requiring hierarchical behavior. A2C's ability to handle both discrete and continuous action spaces makes it versatile for various robotic control tasks. However, its synchronous nature may result in slower wall-clock time learning compared to asynchronous methods, and, like many deep RL algorithms, can be sensitive to hyperparameter choices.
